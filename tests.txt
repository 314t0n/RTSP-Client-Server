Testing Methods
---------------

- While running client, click on different combinations of buttons: SETUP, PLAY, PAUSE,
  STOP and SESSION. Test for the correctness of standard output to see if they are the
  expected values.
- Simulate fluctuating connection stability by sending random fraction lost values back
  to the server via RTCP packets. The server should adjust the video quality sent back
  according the the congestion conditions.
- Run Client on FunkyServer to see if it is able synchronize dropped frames properly.
- Modify the Server code to purposely generate out of sync frames and see if the client 
  can synchronize and show appropriate frames.
- Test for correct packets drop rate statistics. By knowing a fixed amount of dropped
  packets in periodic intervals, see if the client side is showing the correct stats.
