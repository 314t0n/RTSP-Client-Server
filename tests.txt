Testing Methods
---------------

- While running client, click on different combinations of buttons: SETUP, PLAY, PAUSE,
  STOP and SESSION. Test for the correctness of standard output to see if they are the
  expected values.
- Run Client on FunkyServer to see if it is able synchronize dropped frames properly.
- Modify the Server code to purposely generate out of sync frames and see if the client 
  can synchronize and show appropriate frames.
- Test for correct packets drop rate statistics. By knowing a fixed amount of dropped
  packets in periodic intervals, see if the client side is showing the correct stats.
